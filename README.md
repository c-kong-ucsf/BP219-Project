# Uni-tagger: UCSF Programming Project

Uni-tagger is a project that looks at observing RMSD scores of proteins tags appended to a native/novel protein. Current implementation utilizes four tags:
- 6x His
- Calmodulin binding protein (CBP)
- Chitin binding domain (CBD) + 3 Glycine
- mNEONGreen (mNG) + 5 Glycine

This project utilizes the AlphaFold2 [ColabFold project](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) as the project uses structure prediction from user-input sequences. The sequences are then aligned, and the RMSD values are compared to determine how tagged variants deviate from the native conformational structure. 

WARNING: This is a proof of concept, there may still many bugs as well as the results may deviate from experimental data. 

## Installation

No installation required! Just utilize the following link to utilize the tool via Google Colab.

## Instructions

Once you open the Notebook, make sure to run the code in order as many of the function calls are dependent on previously imported statements/packages. Below is the order in which cells should be run.

```python
1. Install Dependencies
2. Import Packages/Modules
3. Run ColabFold Functionality
4. Run RMSD Functionality
5. Load User Interface
6. (optional) Open Public URL
```
